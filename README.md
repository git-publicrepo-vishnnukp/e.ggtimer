Project - Automate E.ggtimer.com

Instructions to execute the script:

Clone the git repo (git clone -b master https://github.com/git-publicrepo-vishnnukp/e.ggtimer.git)
Once downloaded, open the project in your favorite IDE.

To run the project:

1. Right click the project and select Run as 'Run Configurations'.

2. On the left hand pane, right click on 'Maven build' and add 'New Configuration'

3. In the new configuration, click on workspace button and select the project which you imported.

4. And, in the goals enter the following command 'clean test allure:serve -DtestNGRunnerFile=testng.xml -Dbrowser=chrome -Dheadless=false -Denv=prod' and run
And, these options can be modified as well. (eg: browser = firefox, headless=true)

5. Also, allure report has been integrated with this framework. So once the tests run, refresh the project. Expand the Results -> allure-report folder and open the index.html in a browser (Incase, if the report doesn't open automatically)

Build tools - Maven,
Unit testing framework - TestNG,
Programming language - Java 1.8

And all the dependencies are included in pom.xml.

Trouble shooting:
Incase if you get this below error, select jdk from the JRE tab. (Right click on project -> Run configurations -> click on the new configuration which you added under Maven build -> select JRE tab -> And select the JDK from the alternate JRE)

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.2:compile (default-compile) on project e.eggtimer: Compilation failure [ERROR] No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?
